# javascript-challenge
This project displays UFO data in a table on a website that can be filtered by the user.

The purpose of this project is to allow the user to interact with the data themselves and no analysis was performed. This script allows for the user to enter (or not enter) up to five filters and returns to the user any matches for those filters.
